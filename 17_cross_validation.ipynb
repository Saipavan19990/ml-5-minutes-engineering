    "*Data Splitting* :\n",
    "     The dataset is randomly divided into ( k ) equal-sized subsets, known as “folds.”\n",
    "*Training and Validation*:\n",
    "     The model is trained ( k ) times. Each time, one of the ( k ) folds is used as the validation set, and the remaining ( k-1 ) folds are used for training.\n",
    "*Performance Averaging*:\n",
    "     The performance metric (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error) is calculated for each of the ( k ) iterations. The final performance estimate is the average of these ( k ) values.\n",
